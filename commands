mvn package ...............which create a .war file in target folder
create a folder with some name for example package and copy .war file from target folder to package folder(create package folder in the same path were target folder hhas created)
cp target/demo.war root/peerxp/packagee
create a Dockerfile in the same path nothing but our sourcecode path 
vim Dockerfile
explanation:
take a base image as tomcat from dockerhub because were are deploying our appimage into tomcat server
FROM tomcat:9.0
copy the .war file into tomactserver path 
COPY packagee/demo.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ tomcat server path is common path where our demo.war is copying
next step is we will expose here our container port 
EXPOSE 8080
next run the tomcat server by using CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
explanation finished
now build the docker image by tagging with some name
docker build -t myapp .
and create a container with tagged image
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
here we are mapping our container port 8080 to hostport 8000
open the hostport in instance security groups
now copy the instance ip address 
44.203.82.35:8000/demo/---------------paste in google........demo is nothing but when we copy our demo.war to tomact server path it create app as demo
